# Docker Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal learning repository for Docker! This repository contains the code, configurations, and notes from my journey learning Docker, an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.

## Introduction

This repository documents my learning process with Docker. You'll find various projects and examples that I created while exploring containerization, Docker commands, Docker Compose, and more. The goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for myself and others who want to understand Docker and container-based development.

## Branches for Learning Tutorials

I have created multiple branches in this repository, each dedicated to a different Docker tutorial. You can switch between these branches to explore the code and concepts covered in each tutorial. Here are the branches and their descriptions:

- **main**: The main branch contains general notes, Dockerfiles, and setup guides.
- **[geeky-shows](https://github.com/najmul-islam/docker/tree/geeky-shows)**: [Basic Docker tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbGui_ZYuhihMb5pqut64GhW-WhxKpygY)
